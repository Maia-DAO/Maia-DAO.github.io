MaiaDAOâ€™s governance is carried out solely by community members that hold the vote-locked version of the token.
The following are examples of most matters that fall under its purview:
1. Treasury Management Proposals
2. Expenses Proposals
3. Hermes Gauge Voting
4. Partnerships

Governance proposals are ranked in different severity levels depending on the magnitude of short, mid and long term effects changes they can have on the protocols functionality and sustainability. 

The platform's severity level categorization is a crucial aspect of the proposal voting system. It helps to ensure that proposals are given the appropriate level of scrutiny and that their impact on the platform is thoroughly evaluated before implementation. The system is designed to accommodate proposals of varying degrees of severity, and each severity level has its unique requirements. This document outlines the various severity levels of proposals on the platform and their respective characteristics.

| Min Proposal Threshold | Max Proposal Threshold | Min Voting Period | Max Voting Period | Min Voting Delay | Max Voting Delay | Quorum Votes | Proposal Max Operations | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5% GovToken | 5% GovToken | ~2 weeks | ~4 weeks | ~1 week | ~2 weeks | 35,000,000 (35%) | 10 actions | Directing bHermes votes; Expenses; Adding/Removing Gauges for MAIAV2 vaults; Deploying capital in a new strategy (<10% Treasury); Re-sizing currently open strategy/position(s); Deploying capital in a new strategy; New Bond emission or any supply change in MAIA tokens (Maia Minter) |

## Severity Levels Overview

Due to Maia Governance smart contract architecture the Treasury has to yet be divided into different severities/budgets, all proposal currently require a minimum threshold of 5% GovToken supply.  

The quorum required is about 50% of GovToken, and the voting period ranges from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.

These parameters however are subject to change before launch if consensus is reached following the same voting processes.
