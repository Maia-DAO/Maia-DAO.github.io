### Context and Justification by DAO Members:

Before initiating the minting process, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive justification. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how the increased supply will support the DAO’s long-term goals.
- **Market Impact Analysis**: Assessing the potential impact on the token’s market value and overall market dynamics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with increasing the token supply, including inflationary pressures and potential dilution of existing token holders' equity.

### Governance Process
