### Supply Management

In the decentralized finance ecosystem, supply management is important for any DAO's governance token and long-term budgeting. The process involves careful planning and execution to ensure that the token supply aligns with the organization's strategic objectives, such as extending the financial runway or acquiring private funding.

### Procedure: Mint Maia

**Minting Maia tokens** is the primary procedure under supply management. This process enables the DAO to increase the token supply to meet various needs, including extending the financial runway or securing private funding. Here’s a detailed overview of the minting process:

#### Context and Justification

Before initiating the minting process, it is essential to provide a comprehensive justification. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how the increased supply will support the DAO’s long-term goals.
- **Market Impact Analysis**: Assessing the potential impact on the token’s market value and overall market dynamics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with increasing the token supply, including inflationary pressures and potential dilution of existing token holders' equity.
