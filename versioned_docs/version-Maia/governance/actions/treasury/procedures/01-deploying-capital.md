### Contextualization by DAO Members:

When a member or group of members within a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) seeks resources, it is imperative that they provide a comprehensive and deep contextualization of the reasons underlying their resource request. This involves articulating the specific objectives, milestones, and expected outcomes associated with the deployment of resources. By thoroughly elucidating the purpose behind the request, DAO members ensure a transparent and informed decision-making process. This contextualization should encompass market dynamics, risk assessments, and potential impacts on the DAO's overall strategy, fostering a collective understanding among the DAO community about the significance of the proposed resource allocation.



### Resource Deployment Constraints: 

To maintain fiscal prudence and risk mitigation within the DAO, clear constraints are imposed on the deployment of resources. One such constraint stipulates that the amount deployed should never exceed 10% of the total treasury amount. This cap serves as a safeguard, preventing excessive risk exposure and potential negative impacts on the DAO's financial stability. Moreover, it is recommended that DAO members adhere to a more conservative threshold, proposing strategies that recommend deploying only 3-5% of the total treasury amount per proposed strategy. This cautious approach not only aligns with risk management principles but also ensures a diversified and resilient portfolio, safeguarding the interests of the DAO and its stakeholders against unforeseen market fluctuations or adverse circumstances.

### Formalizing Intent through Request for Comment (RFC): 

The process of requesting and allocating resources within a DAO necessitates a structured approach for formalizing the intent behind such proposals. This involves the submission of a Request for Comment (RFC), which serves as a standardized framework for presenting, discussing, and refining resource allocation initiatives. This formalization step ensures that the DAO community has the opportunity to scrutinize, provide feedback, and collectively contribute to the decision-making process. The RFC mechanism not only promotes transparency but also harnesses the collective intelligence of DAO members, enriching the proposal with diverse perspectives before it undergoes formal approval.
