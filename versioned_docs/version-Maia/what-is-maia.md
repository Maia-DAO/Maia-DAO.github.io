Welcome to Maia DAO ðŸ‘‹

Maia is the yield powerhouse of DeFi. With a 100% fair launch via bonds $MAIA is a truly community-owned token.
In turn, the Maian ecosystem aims to be a one-stop shop for different DeFi native financial instruments, a fully fledged trading hub currently featuring:
- **Maia** Decentralized Strategy Vaults
- [**Hermes**](./Hermes/introduction) Omnichain AMM and YLM (Yield and Liquidity Marketplace)
- [**TALOS**](./Talos/introduction) Transparent Automated Liquidity Omnichain Strategies
- [**Ulysses**](./Ulysses/introduction) Omnichain Liquidity and Interoperability Protocol

In order to sustainably bootstrap our surrounding ecosystem, Maia plans to continue onboarding long-term partnerships with protocols that ultimately add value to both our users and partners.

## What is the point of $MAIA?

Maia has significant control over bHermes and has developed a framework for enhanced yield strategies, simplifying your BurntHermes experience, maximizing your yields and contributing to ecosystem sustainability.

$MAIA when staked as [vMAIA](./overview/tokenomics/vMaia) is a utility and governance token that drives the coordination mechanisms behind the whole Maian ecosystem. 

Each [vMAIA](./overview/tokenomics/vMaia) token, grants you voting power for gauge allocations and governance decisions from a basket of burnt Hermes. This ratio can only increase over time, supported by the revenue generated through [**Maia Boosted Strategies**](/protocols/overview/tokenomics/strategies) .

### Locking your $MAIA into vMAIA you will enable you to:

- Vote to control a share of Maia DAO's Voting Power
- Earn bribes on your MAIA Voting Power
- Earn a share of Maia's Treasury Revenue
