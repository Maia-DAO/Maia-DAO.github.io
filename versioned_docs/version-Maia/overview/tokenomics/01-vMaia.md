The vMAIA token is a staked version of the MAIA token, which enables users to take advantage of Maia DAO's bHERMES voting power, allocating it to the gauges of their choice. It also allows users to voice their opinion and participate in the DAO's decision-making process.

Users can stake their MAIA tokens at any time, but can only withdraw their staked tokens on the first Tuesday of each month. The vMAIA token is fungible, which means that it can be used to add liquidity and swap to MAIA if there exists liquidity.

Staking MAIA into vMAIA enables a range of benefits:
- **Delegate Maia's Voting Power**: You can receive a portion of the revenue entitled to MaiaDAO, without having to manually vote for the following week's emission distribution to any pool or strategy, by delegating your MAIA to a third-party – i.e., smart contract – who, in turn, votes for a pool of their choosing. Protocols can also use MAIA to rent liquidity in Hermes by using their MAIA to direct a higher percentage of the following week's emissions to their own pools.

- **Earn Bribes on your vMAIA**: Earn bribes in exchange for your voting power allocation to a given gauge.

- **Increase your Voting Power Accumulation**: Grow your bHERMES voting power with your vMAIA balance. Take advantage of our Boost Aggregator. Read more about [boosting](./boost).

- **Governance Participation**: Vote on proposals and create new ones.

Overall, vMAIA is an important part of the Maia ecosystem, allowing users to participate in the governance of the platform and earn additional rewards through staking their MAIA tokens.
