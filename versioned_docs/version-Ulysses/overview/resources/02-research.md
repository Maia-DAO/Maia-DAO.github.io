# ∆: Solving the Bridging Trilemma

Authors: Ryan Zarick, Bryan Pellegrino and Caleb Banister

> In contrast to existing cross-chain bridges which mint their own tokens on the destination chain in response to the user locking up assets on the source chain,∆Bridgesconduct transfers without involving any intermediate to-kens. This direct use of native assets is what enables ∆ Bridges to scale better than other cross-chain bridges, and is made possible by a pool of liquidity maintained on every chain in the ∆ network
