Welcome to Ulysses Protocol ðŸ‘‹

Ulysses Protocol is a decentralized and permissionless community owned 'Omnichain Liquidity Protocol' designed to promote capital efficiency in the face of an ever more fragmented liquidity landscape in DeFi. 
Enabling Liquidity Providers to deploy their assets from one chain and earn revenue from activity in an array of chains all while mitigating the negative effects of current market solutions. 
In addition, offering a way for DeFi protocols to lower their operational and managing costs by incentivizing liquidity for a single unified liquidity token instead of managing incentives for pools scattered accross different AMMs and chains.  

## Overview

Ulysses Protocol has two major components, the Virtualized and the Unified Liquidity Management. The latter being inspired by the [Delta Algorithm](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf3606jedromp61/Delta-Solving.The.Bridging-Trilemma.pdf?dl=0) put forward by Layer 0. We take this idea one step further by having a single token which represents a basket of Ulysses LPs of the same token from different chains; this unlocks full composability enabling anyone to use this token as they wish, for example in other AMMs like Uniswap V3, Money Markets like Aave, and so on. 

An understanding of the concepts of Ulysses [Ports](./overview/omnichain/ports) and [Virtualized Liquidity](./overview/omnichain/virtual-liquidity) is necessary to fully grasp the mechanics of Ulysses Virtualized Liquidity Management. This is achieved through the use of [Layer0](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/) for cross-chain messaging.

To understand Ulysses Unified Liquidity Solution, it is necessary to first understand the difference between [Ulysses Unified Pools](./overview/unified-liquidity/pools) and [Ulysses Unified Tokens](./overview/unified-liquidity/tokens).
