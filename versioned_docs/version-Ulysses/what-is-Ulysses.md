Welcome to Ulysses Protocol ðŸ‘‹

Ulysses Protocol is a decentralized and permissionless community-owned 'Omnichain Liquidity Protocol' designed to promote capital efficiency in the face of an ever more fragmented liquidity landscape in DeFi. 
Enabling Liquidity Providers to deploy their assets from one chain and earn revenue from activity in an array of chains all while mitigating the negative effects of current market solutions. 
In addition, it offers a way for DeFi protocols to lower their operational costs by incentivizing liquidity for a single unified liquidity token instead of managing incentives for pools scattered across different AMMs and chains.  

## Overview

Ulysses Protocol has two major components, Virtualized and Unified Liquidity Management. The latter uses Arbitrum's [Balancer's Composable Stable Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/composable-stable.html). Ulysses Unified Liquidity aims to take DeFi one step further by enabling a single token that represents a stable LP of the same token from different chains; this unlocks full composability enabling anyone to use this token as they wish, for example in other AMMs like Uniswap V3, Money Markets like Aave, and so on. 

An understanding of the concepts of Ulysses [Ports](./overview/omnichain/ports) and [Virtualized Liquidity](./overview/omnichain/virtual-liquidity) is necessary to fully grasp the mechanics of Ulysses Virtualized Liquidity Management. This is achieved through the use of [Layer0](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/) for cross-chain messaging.
