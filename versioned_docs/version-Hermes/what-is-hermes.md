Welcome to Hermes Protocol ðŸ‘‹

Hermes Protocol V2 is a complete overhaul of V1â€”rebuilt from the ground up, fully audited, and packed with powerful new features. Itâ€™s a decentralized, permissionless, omnichain yield and liquidity marketplace, designed to be community-owned and future-proof.

Designed to improve upon key mechanics like ve(3,3) mechanics from V1, Hermes V2 addresses limitations of existing DeFi protocols while enhancing user experience across the ecosystem.

### Omnichain Concentrated and Unified Liquidity

One of the key features of Hermes Protocol V2 is the ability to swap from and to any chain, using concentrated and unified liquidity. This allows users to easily move between different chains and to take advantage of the unique features and opportunities offered by each. Additionally, users can provide liquidity from and to any of the chains where Hermes is deployed, making it a truly Omnichain liquidity marketplace.

### Renting liquidity

Hermes Protocol V2 also includes a Liquidity Provision assistant, which is designed to make it easier for users to provide liquidity to the protocol and to earn rewards for doing so. The protocol also includes a bribe system, where users can rent liquidity via the incorporated fully decentralized bribe system.

### Yield Marketplace

Finally, the last major feature of Hermes Protocol V2 is the introduction of a yield marketplace, where users can buy and sell the rights to yield. This allows users to earn returns on their assets more flexibly and efficiently, and to take advantage of the different yield opportunities available on different chains.
