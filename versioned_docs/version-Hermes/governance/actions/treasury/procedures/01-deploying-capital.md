title: Deploying Capital
---

When a member or group of members within a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) seeks resources, it is imperative that they provide a comprehensive and deep contextualization of the reasons underlying their resource request. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how the addition will support the DAOâ€™s long-term goals, by articulating the specific objectives, milestones, and expected outcomes associated with the deployment of resources.
- **Performance Analysis**: Considering key metrics relevant to the resource allocation.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with the resource allocation.

### Resource Deployment Constraints:

To practice risk mitigation within the DAO, clear constraints are imposed on the deployment of resources. One such constraint stipulates that the amount deployed should never exceed 10% of the total treasury amount. This cap serves as a safeguard, preventing excessive risk exposure and potential negative impacts on the DAO's financial stability. Moreover, it is recommended that DAO members adhere to a more conservative threshold, proposing strategies that recommend deploying only 3-5% of the total treasury amount per proposed strategy. This cautious approach not only aligns with risk management principles but also ensures a diversified and resilient portfolio, safeguarding the interests of the DAO and its stakeholders against unforeseen market fluctuations or adverse circumstances.
