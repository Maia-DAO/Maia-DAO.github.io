**Description:**
The "Set Tail Emissions" action defines the long-term emission rate of Hermes tokens after initial distribution phases. Tail emissions provide a steady and predictable supply of tokens.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose:** To establish a sustainable emission rate that supports the long-term health of the Hermes ecosystem.
- **Importance:** Ensuring a predictable and controlled token supply helps maintain economic stability and incentivizes continued participation.
- **Process:** Tail emissions rates are proposed and approved through the governance process, reflecting community consensus on sustainable token issuance.
