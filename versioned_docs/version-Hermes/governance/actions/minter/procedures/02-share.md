title: Changing DAO share of emissions
---

**Description:**
The "Set DAO Share" action determines the percentage of total Hermes emissions that will be allocated to the DAO address. This share represents the portion of newly minted tokens that will flow into the DAO's treasury or designated wallet.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** To control the portion of emissions allocated to the DAO, balancing between reinvestment in the community and broader distribution.
- **Importance:** Adjusting the DAO share affects the DAOâ€™s funding and operational capacity.
- **Process:** The DAO share percentage is set through governance proposals, allowing the community to decide the optimal allocation rate.
