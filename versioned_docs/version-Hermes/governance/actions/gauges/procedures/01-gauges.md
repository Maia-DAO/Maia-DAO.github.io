### Context and Justification by DAO Members:

Before initiating the process of adding or removing a gauge, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive justification. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how adding or removing the gauge will support the DAO’s long-term goals.
- **Gauge Performance Analysis**: Taking into consideration key performance metrics such as generated fees and total value locked.
- **Market Impact Analysis**: Assessing the potential impact on the liquidity pool’s performance and overall market dynamics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with the action, including potential changes in yield and liquidity.
