### Context and Justification by DAO Members:

Before initiating the process of adding or removing a gauge factory, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive justification. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how the action will support the DAO’s long-term goals.
- **Market Impact Analysis**: Assessing the potential impact on the DAO’s yield generation and overall market dynamics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with the action, including potential changes in yield sources and liquidity.

### Governance Process

- **Phase 1**: [Request for Comment][phase-1]

- **Phase 2**: [Temperature Check][phase-2] 

- **Phase 3**: [Governance Proposal][phase-3]
