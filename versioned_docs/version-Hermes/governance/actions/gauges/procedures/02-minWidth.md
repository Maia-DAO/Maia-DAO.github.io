### Context and Justification by DAO Members:

Before initiating the process of changing the minimum width of a UniswapV3Gauge, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive justification. This involves:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Clearly articulating how the action will support the DAO’s long-term goals.
- **Market Impact Analysis**: Assessing the potential impact on the DAO’s yield generation, overall market dynamics and existing positions / strategies / integrations.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with the action, including potential changes in yield sources and liquidity (e.g. impermanent loss).

### Governance Process

- **Phase 1**: [Request for Comment][phase-1]

- **Phase 2**: [Temperature Check][phase-2]
