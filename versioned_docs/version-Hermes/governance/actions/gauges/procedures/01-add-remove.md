# I. Overview

This section will outline how to `Adding & Removing Gauges` through Hermes Governance. As outlined in the [Governance Overview][governance-overview], this particular action falls under [Severity Level 2][level2] which involves the following parameters:
| Level |  Threshold <br/> Min - Max | Voting Period | Voting Delay | Quorum | Max Operations | Actions |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| 2     | 0.25 - 2.5%             | 2 days to 2 weeks | 2 days to 1 week | 12.5%         | 10 Actions | • Add/Remove Gauges <br/> • Add/Remove Partners from Incentives Program |

___

In the governance structure, a proposal needs between 0.25% to 2.5% of all votes to be considered, voting on it can last from 2 days to 2 weeks after a review period of 2 days to 1 week, it requires at least 12.5% of all votes to be valid, and can include up to 10 specific actions or changes.

 
 The definitions of what each of these parameters means can be found [here][definitions].


# II. Roles & Responsibility

Governance within the Hermes Protocol is exclusively managed by community members holding the following tokens: 
-  `Burnt Hermes Governance Token` aka bHERMES-G
-  `vote-locked Maia` aka vMaia

For more information on **how to obtain** these tokens, and the exact **mechanisms** in which gives these tokens voting power, please see the documentations for [bHERMES-G][bhermesg-docs] and [vMaia][maia-docs].

# III. Process
The governance involves three key phases:

Request for Comment
Temperature Check


- Phase 1: [Request for Comment][phase-1], where the community is informed about a proposal, sparking initial discussions and feedback.

- Phase 2: [Temperature Check][phase-2], which involves a preliminary off-chain vote to gauge community sentiment.

- Phase 3: [Governance Proposal][phase-3], the final on-chain vote that officially decides the matter.

Typically, this whole procedure, for a `Severity Level 2` such as `Adding or Removing a Gauge`, can take between 1 to 2 weeks to complete, although more complex proposals might require a longer timeframe. Each phase is designed to clarify objectives, gather community input, and ensure a structured decision-making process.

More detailed information about each phase please see [here][governance-process].
