# Hermes Protocol Governance Overview

### **Objective** 
Proposals for governance are categorized into five distinct levels of severity with five being the highest or greatest impact a proposal may potentially have based on the actions permitted. The actions permitted include modifying bribes and gauges to more significant changes like altering the Ulysses Pool or minting new Hermes tokens. This allows for a wide range of governance activities, tailored to the significance of each decision.

### **Requirements**
Governance within the Hermes Protocol is exclusively conducted by community members who have the vote-locked version of the $HERMES token, known as veHERMES (or bHERMES-Governance Token in V2).

### **Overview**
The Severity Levels, Minimum and Maximum Thresholds, Voting Requirements and Actions Permitted are outlined in a table format in the following chart. 

| Level |  Threshold <br/> Min - Max | Voting Period | Voting Delay | Quorum | Max Operations | Actions |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| 1     | 0.1 - 1%                | 24 hrs to 1 week | 1 block to 1 week | 4%            | 10 Actions | • Add/Remove Bribes |
| 2     | 0.25 - 2.5%             | 2 days to 2 weeks | 2 days to 1 week | 12.5%         | 10 Actions | • Add/Remove Gauges <br/> • Add/Remove Partners from Incentives Program |
| 3     | 0.5 - 5%                | 1 week to 3 weeks | 4 days to 1 week | 25%           | 10 Actions | • Add/Remove Gauge System <br/> • Add Ulysses Port to new chain |
| 4     | 0.75 - 7.5%             | 2 weeks to 4 weeks | 1 week to 2 weeks | 35%          | 10 Actions | • Change Weight Ulysses Pool <br/> • Change Weight Ulysses Token |
| 5     | 1 - 10%                 | 2 weeks to 6 weeks | 1 week to 2 weeks | 50%          | 10 Actions | •  Add/Remove New Ulysses Root Router <br/>  • Add Destinations to Ulysses Pool <br/> •  Add/Remove LP Ulysses Token <br/> • Mint Hermes |

### **Defintions**

**Level**: Indicates the severity of the proposal within the governance structure. Level 1 represents the least severe proposals, while Level 5 includes the most severe proposals.

**Min/Max Threshold**:This represents the range of voting power required to participate in the decision-making process for a proposal. The minimum threshold is the lowest percentage of total GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance) votes needed to consider a proposal, and the maximum threshold is the highest percentage allowed.

**Voting Period**: The time frame during which votes can be cast for a proposal. This period varies depending on the severity level, ranging from as short as 24 hours to as long as 6 weeks.

**Voting Delay**: The time interval between the proposal's submission and the start of the voting period. This delay allows members to review and consider the proposal before voting begins.

**Quorum**: The minimum percentage of total GovToken votes required for the voting results to be considered valid. This ensures that a significant portion of the community participates in the decision-making process.

**Max Operations**: The maximum number of actions or changes that can be executed under a single proposal. This limit helps maintain focus and prevents over-complication of proposals.

**Actions**: Specific changes or operations that can be proposed and voted on at each severity level. These actions range from adding or removing bribes at Level 1 to more impactful decisions like minting Hermes tokens at Level 5.

## Next Steps in Understanding Governance
Having outlined the fundamental aspects of governance within the Hermes Protocol, including the objective, requirements, and a brief overview of the severity levels, we now move towards a more detailed exploration. The following section will provide an in-depth analysis of each severity level, offering insights into the specific actions permitted, and the implications of these actions on the governance process.
