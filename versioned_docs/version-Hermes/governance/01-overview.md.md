Hermes Protocol’s governance is carried out solely by community members that hold the vote-locked version of the token.

Governance proposals are ranked in different severity levels depending on the magnitude of short, mid and long term effects changes they can have on the protocols functionality and sustainability. 

| Level | Min Proposal Threshold | Max Proposal Threshold | Min Voting Period | Max Voting Period | Min Voting Delay | Max Voting Delay | Quorum Votes | Proposal Max Operations | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.1% GovToken | 1% GovToken | ~24 hours | ~1 week | 1 block | ~1 week | 4,000,000 (4%) | 10 actions | Adding/Removing Bribes |
| 2 | 0.25% GovToken | 2.5% GovToken | ~2 days | ~2 weeks | ~2 days | ~1 week | 12,500,000 (12.5%) | 10 actions | Adding/Removing Gauges, Adding/Removing Partners from Incentives Program |
| 3 | 0.5% GovToken | 5,000,000 GovToken | ~1 week | ~3 weeks | ~4 days | ~1 week | 25,000,000 (25%) | 10 actions | Add/Remove Gauge System, Add Ulysses Port to new chain |
| 4 | 0.75% GovToken | 7.5% GovToken | ~2 weeks | ~4 weeks | ~1 week | ~2 weeks | 35,000,000 (35%) | 10 actions | Change Weight Ulysses Pool, Change Weight Ulysses Token |
| 5 | 1% GovToken | 10,000,000 GovToken | ~2 weeks | ~6 weeks | ~1 week | ~2 weeks | 50,000,000 (50%) | 10 actions | Add/Remove New Ulysses Root Router, Add Destinations to Ulysses Pool, Add/Remove LP Ulysses Token, Hermes Minter |

## Severity Levels Overview

This level’s proposals are the least severe among the five levels, suitable for minor changes not affecting user funds, such as updating tokens eligibility to be deposited as bribes that do not significantly impact the platform's functioning.
These proposals require a minimum threshold of 0.1% and a maximum threshold of 1% of GovToken for voting eligibility. The quorumVotes required is 4% of GovToken, and the voting period ranges from 24 hours to 1 week.

### Severity 2

This level’s proposals have a moderate severity level and are appropriate for proposals that have a slightly more significant impact on the platform, such as adding or removing gauges or partners from incentive programs. Users can lose unclaimed rewards at the time of the update.
These proposals require a minimum threshold of 0.25% and a maximum threshold of 2.5% of GovToken. The quorumVotes required is about 12.5% of GovToken, and the voting period ranges from 2 days to 2 weeks.

### Severity 3

Any proposal on architectural changes to our system that may hinder utilization for a given period. These are more severe and are suitable for proposals that impact the gauge system significantly, such as adding or removing it from the platform
These proposals require a minimum threshold of 0.5% and a maximum threshold of 5% GovToken. The quorum required is about 25% of GovToken, and the voting period is about 1 week to 3 weeks.

### Severity 4

Proposals found on this level are more critical and require a higher minimum threshold of 0.75% and a maximum threshold of 7.5% of GovToken. 
These proposals have a more significant impact on the platform and/or protocols bottom line, such as changing the weight in a Ulysses pool or adding a Hermes Minter (emission allocation), capital applications up to 10% of the treasury.

The quorum required is about 35% of GovToken, and the voting period ranges from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.

### Severity 5

proposals are the most severe, requiring a minimum threshold of 1% and a maximum threshold of 10% GovToken. These proposals have a considerable impact on the platform, or protocols token supply such as adding or removing new Ulysses root router, LP Ulysses tokens, or  

The quorum required is about 50% of GovToken, and the voting period ranges from 2 weeks to 6 weeks.

In conclusion, the severity level categorization is a crucial aspect of the platform's proposal voting system. Each level has unique characteristics and requirements, designed to ensure that proposals are given the appropriate level of scrutiny and their impact on the platform is thoroughly evaluated. It is essential to carefully consider the severity level when proposing changes to the platform.
