# Severity Levels & Implications

### Severity 1

Proposals at this level represent the least severe category within the five-tier system. They are intended for minor adjustments that do not directly affect user funds. An example includes updating the eligibility of tokens to be deposited as bribes, which do not significantly alter the platform's core functionality.

- Voting Threshold: 0.1% to 1% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Quorum Requirement: 4% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Voting Period: 24 hours to 1 week

### Severity 2

Proposals under this category are of moderate severity. They are suitable for changes that exert a slightly more substantial influence on the platform, such as the addition or removal of gauges or partners within incentive programs. Note that these changes may lead to the loss of unclaimed rewards at the time of implementation.

- Voting Threshold: 0.25% to 2.5% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Quorum Requirement: 12.5% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Voting Period: 2 days to 1 week

### Severity 3

This level addresses proposals involving architectural modifications that could temporarily affect system utilization. These proposals are more severe, often impacting the gauge system significantly, such as its addition or removal.

- Voting Threshold: 0.5% to 5% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Quorum Requirement: 25% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
- Voting Period: 1 week to 3 weeks

### Severity 4

Level 4 proposals are critical and necessitate a higher engagement from the community. These include significant changes like altering the weight in a Ulysses pool or introducing a Hermes Minter for emission allocation, with potential implications for up to 10% of the treasury.

Voting Threshold: 0.75% to 7.5% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
Quorum Requirement: 35% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
Voting Period: 2 weeks to 4 weeks

### Severity 5

The most severe proposals fall under this category. They encompass major decisions affecting the platform or the protocol's token supply, such as adding or removing new Ulysses root routers or LP Ulysses tokens.

Voting Threshold: 1% to 10% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
Quorum Requirement: 50% of GovToken (aka bHERMES-Governance Token)
Voting Period: 2 weeks to 6 weeks

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the severity level categorization is a crucial aspect of the platform's proposal voting system. Each level has unique characteristics and requirements, designed to ensure that proposals are given the appropriate level of scrutiny and their impact on the platform is thoroughly evaluated. It is essential to carefully consider the severity level when proposing changes to the platform.
