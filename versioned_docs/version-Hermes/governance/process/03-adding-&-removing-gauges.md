## Gauge Addition/Removal proposal (GAP)

---

To help our own and our partnerâ€™s communities better position themselves to finish this process until V2 launch, partner on-boarding prior to V2 will only consist of Phase 1 and Phase 2. Because of that, Phase 2 will need to include the information that would be included in the on-chain proposal, like requested actions, that would be included in Phase 3.

### 3 Phases:
[Phase 1: Request for Comment][phase-1]
[Phase 2: Temperature Check][phase-2]
[Phase 3: Governance Proposal][phase-3]

[phase-1]: ./versioned_docs/version-Hermes/governance/process/phases/01-phase-1-request-for-comment.md
[phase-2]: ./versioned_docs/version-Hermes/governance/process/phases/02-phase-2-temperature-check.md
[phase-3]: ./versioned_docs/version-Hermes/governance/process/phases/03-phase-3-governance-proposal.md
