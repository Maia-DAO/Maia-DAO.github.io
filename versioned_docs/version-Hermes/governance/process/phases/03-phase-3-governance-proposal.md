### **Phase 3: Governance Proposal**

**Timeframe:** 2 day waiting period, 7 day voting period

Proposal creation threshold: 2.5M bHERMES

**Quorum:** 12.5M bHERMES

**Form:** [TBD]

Phase 3 is the final step of the governance process. If this vote passes, then a change will be enacted on-chain.

To create an on-chain Governance Proposal:

1. Incorporate any last iterations to your proposal based on feedback prior to posting. 
   <!-- This step suggests making final changes to the proposed governance proposal based on received feedback before proceeding further. -->

2. Create a topic in the [TBD] titled “POP - Governance Proposal — [Your Title Here]” and link to previous forum posts and the Partnering On-boarding Proposal Temperature Check Snapshot poll. 
   <!-- This step involves creating a new topic in a platform (to be determined) with a specific title and linking to related forum posts and polls. -->

3. Create your proposal. This can be done either through an interface (on [TBD]) or through writing the calldata for more complicated proposal logic. This calldata will be executed if and when the proposal passes. If writing the calldata yourself, please review the logic with a qualified Hermes community member prior to posting the proposal. 
   <!-- This step focuses on creating the actual proposal. It can be done using an interface (on a platform to be determined) or by writing custom calldata for complex proposal logic. It is recommended to review the calldata logic with a qualified Hermes community member before posting the proposal. -->

4. Ensure that at least 2.5 million bHERMES is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated bHERMES to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf. 
   <!-- This step emphasizes the need to have at least 2.5 million bHERMES delegated to your address to submit a proposal. Alternatively, you can find a delegate who meets the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf. -->

5. Once the proposal has been submitted (or the propose() function has been called), a two day voting delay will start. After the voting delay is finished, a seven day voting period begins. If the proposal passes successfully, the proposed code is executed. 
   <!-- This step indicates that after submitting the proposal or calling the propose() function, there will be a two-day waiting period for voting to begin. Once the waiting period is over, a seven-day voting period starts. If the proposal passes during this time, the proposed code will be executed. -->
