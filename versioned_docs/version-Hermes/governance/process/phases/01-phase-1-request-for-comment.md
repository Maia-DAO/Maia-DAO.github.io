### **Phase 1: Request for Comment (POP-RFC)**

**Timeframe:** Minimum 3 days

**Form:** [Governance Forum](https://commonwealth.im/hermes-omnichain/discussions) Post

The first phase of the governance process is meant to allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions about the new partner in question and how it will benefit the ecosystem.
<!-- This section explains that Phase 1 of the governance process is aimed at giving the community time to understand and discuss a proposal. They are encouraged to provide comments and ask questions related to the new partner and how their involvement can benefit the ecosystem. -->

In their proposal, the partner should clearly specify the desired tier they are applying for and provide detailed, verifiable information on how they plan to meet the associated requirements. They must also outline a transparent framework that allows any community member to easily track and evaluate their progress towards achieving the milestones set by the partner. This framework should include measurable objectives and verifiable data sources.
