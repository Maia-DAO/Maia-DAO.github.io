### **Phase 2: Temperature Check (POP-TC)**

**Timeframe:** 5 days

**Quorum:** 10M bHERMES

**Form:** [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/hermesprotocol.eth/)

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to signal community sentiment on the new partner on-boarding proposal prior to moving towards an on-chain vote.

To create a Temperature Check:

1. Incorporate the community feedback from the RFC phase into the proposal. 
   <!-- This step involves taking into account the feedback received from the Request for Comments (RFC) phase and incorporating it into the proposal. -->

2. Create and post this version of the proposal in the [Governance Forum](https://commonwealth.im/hermes-omnichain/discussions) with the following title “POP-TC - [Your Title Here]”. Include a link to the POP-RFC post. You will update the post to include a link to the Snapshot poll after you’ve posted that. 
   <!-- This step requires creating and posting the updated version of the proposal in the Governance Forum with a specific title. It is important to include a link to the respective Request for Comments (RFC) post. The post should be further updated to include a link to the Snapshot poll once it is posted. -->

3. Create a [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/hermesprotocol.eth/). The voting options should consist of those which have gained support in the POP-RFC Phase. This poll can be either binary or multiple choice but must include a “Nay” option. Set the poll duration to 5 days. Include a link to the Forum Partnering On-boarding Proposal Temperature Check post. 
   <!-- This step involves creating a Snapshot poll using the provided platform. The voting options for the poll should be based on those that have received support during the POP-RFC phase. The poll can be binary or multiple choice but must include a "Nay" option. The duration of the poll should be set to 5 days. It is important to include a link to the Forum Partnering On-boarding Proposal Temperature Check post in the poll. -->

4. Update the Forum post with a link to the Snapshot Poll. 
   <!-- This step requires updating the Forum post created in step 2 with a link to the Snapshot Poll created in step 3. -->

At the end of 5 days, the option with the majority of votes wins. There must be at least 10M bHERMES yes votes to move onto Phase 3. If the “Nay” option wins, the proposal will not move onto the Phase 3.

Until V2 launch that will have full on-chain governance, proposals that pass Phase 2 don’t need to continue to Phase 3. They are considered passed and will be executed when migrating from V1 to V2.
