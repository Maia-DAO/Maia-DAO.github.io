# Phase 2: Temperature Check

### **Objective**
Following the successful conclusion of Phase 1 - [Request for Comment][phase-1], which spanned a minimum of three days, we are now ready to transition into Phase 2, Temperature Check. 

This phase is designed to gauge community sentiment and signal readiness for the proposal, leading up to an on-chain vote via Snapshot.

### **Requirements**
- Duration: 5 days
- Quorum: "Yay" vote of at least 10% of Total bHERMES Supply
- Method: [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/hermesprotocol.eth/)

### **How To Create a Temperature Check**

1. Incorporate the community feedback from the RFC phase into the proposal. 

2. Create and post this version of the proposal in the [Governance Forum](https://commonwealth.im/hermes-omnichain/discussions) with the following title “POP-TC - [Your Title Here]”. Include a link to the POP-RFC post. You will update the post to include a link to the Snapshot poll after you’ve posted that. 

3. Create a [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/hermesprotocol.eth/). The voting options should consist of those which have gained support in the POP-RFC Phase. This poll can be either binary or multiple choice but must include a “Nay” option. Set the poll duration to 5 days. Include a link to the Forum Partnering On-boarding Proposal Temperature Check post. 

4. Update the Forum post with a link to the Snapshot Poll. 

### **Next Steps:** 
At the end of 5 days, the option with the majority of votes wins. Quorum must be met with at least 10% of Total Supply of bHERMES as "Yay" votes to move onto Phase 3. If the “Nay” option wins, the proposal will not move onto the Phase 3.

### **Key Considerations**  <span style="color: red;">[Critical Advisory] </span> 
Until the launch of V2, which features a full-stack built-in on-chain governance mechanism, <span style="color: red;"> proposals that pass Phase 2 do not need to continue to Phase 3</span> . They are considered passed and will be executed when migrating from V1 to V2.
