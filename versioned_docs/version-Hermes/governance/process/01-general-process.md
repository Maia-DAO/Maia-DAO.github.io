## General Process


```javascript
To help our own and our partnerâ€™s communities better position themselves to finish this process until V2 launch, partner on-boarding prior to V2 will only consist of Phase 1 and Phase 2. Because of that, Phase 2 will need to include the information that would be included in the on-chain proposal, like requested actions, that would be included in Phase 3.
```


### 3 Phases:

1. Phase 1: Request for Comment 
2. Phase 2: Temperature Check
3. Phase 3: Governance Proposal
